Currently, APF protocol is derive from Postfix Policy protocol, and
they are almost the same under Postfix MTA.

Under qmail and sendmail, only some of the attributes listed below
are available, they are:

   request
   protocol_state
   protocol_name
   helo_name
   sender
   recipient
   client_address

No more attributes supported across different MTA. If you need more
control over SMTP session, please merge to the Postfix MTA :-)

Protocol detail
===============

Each query is a bunch of attributes. Order does not matter, and
the demo script uses only a few of all the attributes shown below:

   request=smtpd_access_policy
   protocol_state=RCPT
   protocol_name=SMTP
   helo_name=some.domain.tld
   queue_id=8045F2AB23
   sender=foo@bar.tld
   recipient=bar@foo.tld
   client_address=1.2.3.4
   client_name=another.domain.tld
   instance=123.456.7
   sasl_method=plain
   sasl_username=you
   sasl_sender=
   size=12345
   [empty line]

The policy server script will answer in the same style, with an
attribute list followed by a empty line:

   action=dunno
   [empty line]
