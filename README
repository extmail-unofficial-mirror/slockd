About Spam Locker
=================

The spam locker is a rewrite to the commerical APF Server, base
on APF (Antispam Policy Framework) and MSPF technology, license
under the term of GPL v2. It use Net::Server to simplify process
management and gain stability.

But the spam locker is not suitable for very high volume traffic

per day, you had better try other policy server written in C for
efficency, or move spam locker to a dedicated server with large
memory.
